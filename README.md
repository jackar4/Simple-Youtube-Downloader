# Simple-Youtube-Downloader
A Really Simple Youtube Downloader made by me in python.

really easy to use, you just open the **main.py** and it asks you for a video link, when you put it in it downloads the video into /downloads/[video creators name]/[video]

easy as that!

(This is a program just for people learning python and wanting to do this to just see how it's done and all of things like that.
